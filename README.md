# Big-O Notation Practice Project

This project provides exercises for understanding and analyzing time complexity using Big-O notation.

## Contents

* **expressions.md:**  A file with mathematical expressions to simplify.
* **functions.js:** A JavaScript file containing functions for which you'll determine the Big-O time complexity.
* **short_answers.txt:** A text file with short answer questions related to Big-O notation and the time complexity of common operations.
* **solutions.md:** (Optional) A file where you can put the solutions and explanations for the exercises.

## Instructions

1. **Simplifying Expressions:**  In "expressions.md",  simplify the given Big-O expressions as much as possible, following the rules of Big-O notation.
2. **Analyzing Functions:** Analyze the functions in "functions.js" and determine their time complexity. Write your answers next to each function, or in "solutions.md".
3. **Short Answers:**  Answer the Big-O-related questions in "short_answers.txt".

## Example

**Expression:** 
O(n^2 + 100n)

**Simplified:**
O(n^2) 

## Learning Goals

completing this project will enable the user:
* Improve your understanding of how to simplify Big-O expressions.
* Practice analyzing the time complexity of code snippets.
* Solidify your knowledge of common Big-O complexities for built-in data structures and methods.
